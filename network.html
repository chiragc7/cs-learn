      <h2>What is Networking?</h2>
      <p>
        Networking refers to the practice of connecting computers and other devices together 
        so they can share resources and information. It is the backbone of internet communication.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="types">
      <h2>Types of Networks</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers a small area like home, office, or school.</li>
        <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Covers large geographic areas, such as the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Connects users in a city or large campus.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Networks (Wi-Fi):</strong> Connects devices using radio signals instead of cables.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

<h2>LAN (Local Area Network)</h2>
<p>A LAN connects computers and devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, school, or campus. 
    It allows users to share resources like files, printers,
     and internet connections easily and quickly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Covers a small geographic area</li>
<li>High-speed connection (usually wired or Wi-Fi)</li>
<li>Low setup and maintenance cost</li>
<li>Typically owned and managed by a single person or organization</li>
<li>Example: Computers connected in a school lab</li>

</ul>

<h2>2. WAN (Wide Area Network)</h2>
<p>A WAN spans a large geographic area â€” like cities,
     countries, or even continents. The internet is the largest WAN in existence. 
     WANs are used to connect smaller networks (like LANs)
     to each other over long distances.</p>

<ul>
<li>Covers a wide area using leased telecom lines</li>
<li>Lower speed than LANs (but improving with fiber optics)</li>
<li>Higher cost to maintain</li>
<li>Often managed by service providers (ISPs)</li>
<li> Example: A multinational company connecting its global branches</li>

</ul>


<h2> 3. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</h2>
<p>A MAN covers a city-sized area and is larger than 
    a LAN but smaller than a WAN. It connects multiple LANs within a specific geographic area like
     a university campus or a metropolitan city.</p>

<ul>
<li>Medium-range coverage (city-wide)</li>
<li>High-speed connectivity</li>
<li>Often maintained by government or large organizations</li>
<li>Used to connect schools, colleges, or city offices</li>
<li>Example: A city-wide Wi-Fi network for public access</li>
</ul>


<h2>4. Wireless Network (Wi-Fi)</h2>
<p>Wireless networks use radio waves to transmit data instead of physical cables. 
    Devices like smartphones, laptops, 
    and tablets connect to wireless routers to access the internet.</p>

<ul>
<li>No need for physical cables</li>
<li>Offers mobility and flexibility</li>
<li>Slightly lower speed than wired connections</li>
<li>Can be public (open Wi-Fi) or private (home network)</li>
<li>Example: Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or home</li>

</ul>


    <section class="devices">
      <h2>Common Networking Devices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Router:</strong> Connects different networks together and manages traffic.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch:</strong> Connects multiple devices within a LAN.</li>
        <li><strong>Modem:</strong> Connects your home network to your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</li>
        <li><strong>Access Point:</strong> Provides wireless connectivity to wired networks.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

<h2>1. Router</h2>
<p>A router is a device that connects different networks
     together â€” such as your home network to the internet. It routes (or directs) data packets between networks and assigns 
    local IP addresses to devices on your network.</p>

<ul>

<li>Connects LAN to the internet</li>
<li>Manages data traffic between networks</li>
<li>Often includes built-in firewall and wireless capabilities</li>
<li>Supports multiple devices</li>
<li>Example: The router at home that lets phones, TVs, and laptops access the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Switch</h2>
<p>A switch is used within a Local Area Network (LAN) to connect multiple devices such as
     computers, printers, and servers. It sends data only to the device itâ€™s intended for,
     making the network efficient and secure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Works at the data link layer (Layer 2)</li>
<li>Transfers data to specific devices using MAC addresses</li>
<li>Increases LAN performance and reduces collisions</li>
<li>Can be unmanaged (plug & play) or managed (configurable)</li>
<li>Example: Office switch that connects 10 computers to one internal network</li>

</ul>


<h2>3. Modem</h2>
<p>A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts digital data 
    from a computer to analog signals for transmission over phone lines, and vice versa.
     It is essential for connecting to the 
    internet via an ISP (Internet Service Provider).</p>

<ul>
    <li>Converts digital data to analog and back</li>
    <li>Acts as a bridge between home/office network and ISP</li>
    <li>Required for DSL or cable internet connections</li>
    <li>Example: The box provided by your ISP to get internet access at home.    </li>


</ul>

<h2>4. Access Point (AP)</h2>
<p>An Access Point is a device that extends the range of a wired network by 
    adding wireless capability. It connects to a switch or router and allows 
    Wi-Fi-enabled devices to connect to the network wirelessly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Extends Wi-Fi coverage</li>
<li>Connects wireless devices to the wired network</li>
<li>Often used in large offices, schools, and public places</li>
<li>Example: Wi-Fi extenders or mesh network points used in large homes or campuses.</li>

</ul>

      <h2>Why Learn Networking?</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding networking helps in troubleshooting internet problems, setting up secure systems, 
        and is essential for careers in IT, cybersecurity, and cloud computing.
