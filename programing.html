      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Programming Fundamentals is the foundation course that introduces you to the world of programming. 
        You'll learn basic concepts such as variables, data types, loops, conditions, and functions.
      </p>

    <section class="topics">
      <h2>Core Topics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>If Statements</li>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>Loops</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

<h2>Variables</h2>
<p>A variable has a name, and you can store something in it.</p>
<p>In computer science, a variable is a named storage location in the computer's memory that holds a value. This value can be changed (or varied), which is why itâ€™s called a variable.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A variable has a name (also called an identifier).</li>
<li>It stores data like numbers, text, or boolean values.</li>
<li>The value of a variable can change during program execution.</li>
<li>Variables make programs more flexible and easier to understand.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is an if...else Statement?</h2>
<p>In computer science, an if...else statement is a conditional statement
     that helps a program make decisions. It tells the computer to execute a block
      of code only if a specified condition is true. If the condition is false,
     another block of code (the else part) can be executed.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>if checks a condition (like whether a number is greater than 10).</li>
    <li>If the condition is true, a specific set of instructions is executed. </li>
    <li>If the condition is false, the code in the else block runs (if present).</li>
    <li>it's a basic building block of decision making in programming.</li>

</ul>

<h2> What is an Array?</h2>
<p>In computer science, an array is a collection of elements (values or variables),
     all of the same data type, stored at contiguous memory locations. Arrays are used to store multiple
      values in a single variable, 
    instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays have a fixed size (defined at the time of declaration).
</li>
<li>Elements are accessed using indexes, starting from 0.</li>
<li>Arrays store homogeneous data (same type: all integers, all strings, etc.).</li>
<li>Arrays make it easy to work with multiple values in loops and conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸ”„ What is a Loop?</h2>
<p>In computer science, a loop is a control structure that allows code to be repeated multiple times based on a condition. It helps reduce redundancy and write efficient, compact code.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Loops repeat a block of code while a condition is true.</li>
<li>There are three main types of loops:</li>
<ol>
    <li>for loop â€“ used when the number of iterations is known.</li>
    <li>while loop â€“ used when the condition is checked before execution.</li>
    <li>do...while loop â€“ used when the condition is checked after execution.
    </li>
</ol>
</ul>

<h2>ðŸ§© What is a Function?</h2>
<p>In computer science, a function is a reusable block of 
  code designed to perform a specific task. Instead of writing the same code again and again,
   you can write a function once and call it whenever needed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions make programs modular and organized.</li>
<li>A function has:</li>
<ol>
  <li>A name</li>
  <li>Optional parameters</li>
  <li>A body (set of instructions)</li>
  <li>An optional return value</li>

</ol>
<li>Functions help reduce code duplication and improve readability.</li>
</ul>

      <h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
      <p>
        After completing this course, you will be able to write simple programs, understand logic building, and move on to advanced programming languages.
