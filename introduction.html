        The computer is well-known to us, the first counting device our
         ancestors used in the early decades. But also before that, they
          utilized sticks, bones, and stones as their counting implements.
           As the evolution of the human mind and technology improved with time,
            the existence of more computing devices increased. In this tutorial,
          we will learn the History of computers and the Timeline according to the
           subsequent years.
      </p>


      <h2>First Computer Design</h2>
      <p>In the 19th century, a renowned Mathematician, Charles Babbage,
         developed and partly built a Victorian-era computer named the Analytical Engine.
          The fundamental component of the oldest machine was the input,
          having the programs and data that the user had to provide to the Analytical Machine
           through punched cards,
           a technique being employed at the time to handle mechanical looms like the Jacquard loom.
         The design of the analytical engine was initiated in 1833.</p>

        <h2>The Function of Ancient Computers</h2>
        <p>The computer was born not for amusement or email but out of a requirement to solve a
             complicated number-crunching crisis. 
             By 1880, the American population had expanded so
              widely that it took more than seven years to tabulate
               the US census results. The government pursued a quicker method
                to get the job done, offering an upgrade to the punch-card-based computers
                 that grabbed up total room space.
         </p>
         <h2>Ancient Theory of Computers</h2>
         <p>Eventually, the notion of numerals became tangible and familiar enough for 
            counting to emerge and instructing sequences to others.
             It led to the evolution of the numerical system and mathematical notation, 
             such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, 
             and squaring, as mathematical operations. All this led to the birth of the 
             Calculator by Blaise Pascal in 1642.
             Its name is Pascaline.</p>


            <h2>Generations of computers</h2>
            <p>From the 19th century to the present day,
                 the role of the computer in its users' lives is crucial.
                  However, in today's generation, this computer may work a
                   little differently and more advanced than in the 19th century.
                    But it served the purpose it is to its users and remained the same.
                 This tutorial describes various generations of computers in detail.
            </p>

            <h2>First Generation Computers</h2>
            <p>By 1940, vacuum tubes, electronic devices that
                 regulate the flow of electrons in a vacuum, were used.
                  These were the first computer systems that the users utilized 
                  for circuitry and magnetic drums and were usually massive, 
                  capturing up an entire room. These computers were very costly to operate in the
                   spare of employing a great deal of electricity. At that time, the most common computer
                    language that the first generation computers depended on was the machine language, 
                    the lowest-level programming language that the computers understood for executing operations. The UNIVAC and ENIAC
                 computers are specimens of first-generation computing devices.
                </p>

                <h2>Second Generation Computer</h2>
                <p>In 1956, the technology of transistors replaced 
                    the bulkier generation of vacuum tubes.
                     After the invention of these transistors,
                      the dimensions of the computer were also reduced.
                       Second-generation computers evolved smaller in size compared to
                        first-generation computers. Second-generation computers developed from 
                        enigmatic binary machine language to representational symbolic systems,
                         or assembly languages, that authorized the programmers to appoint instructions in words or phrases. 
                         IBM1400 series, PDP-8, IBM 7090 and 7094, UNIVAC 1107, CDC 3600, etc.,
                         are a few examples of the second generation.</p>

                    <h2>Thired Generation Computers</h2>
                    <p>This generation started developing integrated circuits in 1964.
                         Instead of using punch cards and printouts, users could interact 
                         with third-generation computers via keyboards and monitors and interfaced
                          with an operating system. For the first time, computers reached a mass audience, as they were smaller
                         and cheaper than the past prototypes. Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor
                          developed integrated circuits by 1950.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Fourth Generation Computers</h2>
                    <p>By 1971, users operated the first microprocessors,
                         the Large-Scale Integration (LSI) circuits created on 
                         one chip called microprocessors. The microprocessor was conducted 
                         in the fourth generation of computers, as developers built thousands
                          of integrated circuits onto a single silicon chip. 
                          What if the first generation served an entire room that could accommodate
                           within a palm? The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the computer 
                           components from the Central Processing Unit and memory to input or output authorities
                            on a single chip.

                    </p>

                    <h2>Fifth Generation Computers</h2>
                    <p>The technology on which the fifth generation of
                         computers relies is AI. It authorizes computers to conduct like humans.
                          Today's computers are so developed that users utilize them in every distinct field,
                           primarily accounting, constructing buildings, space research, engineering technologies,
                            and other types of analysis. The principal purpose of fifth-generation computing is to create 
                            devices that react to natural language input and are competent in learning and self-organizing.

                    </p>




                    <h2>Types of Computer Architecture</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Von-Neumann Architecture</li>
                      <li>Harvard Architecture</li>
                      <li>Instruction Set Architecture</li>
                      <li>Micro-architecture</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Von-Neumann Architecture</h2>
                    <p>John von Neumann coined and developed this architecture. 
                      The computer we are using nowadays is based on the von Neumann architecture.
                       It has some concepts. It is also known as Princeton architecture. It renders a unique
                       design for the electronic digital systems having the following components:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Harvard Architecture</h2>
                    <p>Harvard Architecture consists of code and data laid in distinct
                       memory sections. It requires a separate memory block for data and instruction. 
                       It has solely contained data storage within the Central Processing Unit (CPU).
                        A single collection of clock cycles is needed. Data accessibility in one memory is done by 
                      a single memory location in the case of Harvard architecture.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Instruction Set Architecture</h2>
                    <p>Another notable digital computer architecture is the Instruction Set Architecture.
                       The architecture holds a collection of instructions that the processor renders and surmises.
                        It consists of two instruction sets: RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) and CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer).

                      It enables versatile implementations of an ISA, commonly
                       differing in features such as performance, physical size, and monetary price.
                        It empowers the evolution of the micro-architectures, implementing ISA as an exclusive,
                         higher-performance system that can run software on preceding generations of execution.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Micro-architecture</h2>
                    <p>Micro-architecture is the structural design of a microprocessor. This computer organization leverages
                       a method where the instruction
                       set architecture holds a built-in processor.
                       Engineers and hardware scientists implement instruction set architecture (ISA) with various micro-architectures 
                       that vary because of changing technology. It includes the technologies used, resources, and methods. Using this,
                        the processors physically devised to administer a particular instruction set.

                      It is a logical form of all electronic elements and data
                       pathways present in the microprocessor, designed in a specific way. It allows for the optimal
                        completion of instructions. In academia, it is called computer organization.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Input Devices</h2>
                    <h2>Types of Inputs Devices</h2>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>Output Devices </h2>
                    <p>A peripheral device that helps a computer system to
                       reproduce input data or instructions is called an output unit of a
                        computer. After a user enters the raw data as input, the processor receives
                         that information and processes the data. Then, the computer system distributes
                          the processed data to the users through various output units. Output devices transform 
                          computer data into a human-understandable form. This tutorial is an easy way to learn more basic ideas 
                      on the different types of output devices and their utility.
